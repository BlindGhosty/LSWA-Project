# LSWA-Project
Repo for LSWA Project - Fall 2017

Deadlines + Spec:
> From Course Projects 2017

Project Design: A two to four pages Google doc describing exactly what you plan to do. The design will include the following information:
The high level and detailed design.
The languages and technologies you intend to use (e.g. list the open source tools you intend to use).
The exact scope of the project. What you intend to do and what you don’t.
The breakdown of tasks by project members. Who is in charge of what.
I may comment on the design and ask for modifications. Once I’m satisfied with the design, I will approve it.

Project Demo: Teams may elect to participate in the NYU project showcase (contingent on space first-come-first-serve). These teams will NOT have to demo the projects in class. The other teams will have a 10 minute slot to demo their project in class. You will need to be ready to answer questions about your projects.

Project Submission: This will include the code for the project plus either a short presentation in slides (4 slides), or a poster.
Dec 21st is the submission deadline.
Submission deadline is 9pm EST.
On december 21th between 9pm to 11pm your projects have to be up and running in some publicly accessible IP address and port.
A submission email must be sent to yys220@nyu.edu by 9pm. It will include the following:
Either tarball with your submission code, or the address of a publically available git repo that I can pull the code from. There is no need for me to able to run your code, so if you want to, you can exclude from the submission irrelevant files such as libraries you depend on.
Link to the presentation slides shared document.
The URL to where your service is running until 11pm that night, with any additional information I will need, such as test account credentials if they apply, or whether I should create a new account.
